# Security Compliance Compatibility

Now that you know the basic [Architecture overview](./01-architecture-overview.md) and [what is
deployed](./02-whats-deployed.md), let's take a look at what compliance frameworks are covered by the infrastructure
deployed with this code.

The security practices employed by the infrastructure deployed from this code follows the Gruntwork Security Best
Practices (detailed in [this
document](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTikva7hXPd2h1SSglJWhlW8W6qhMlZUxl0qQ9rUJ0OX22CQNeM-91w4lStRk9u2zQIn6lPejUbe-dl/pub)).
These practices are inspired by the various compliance frameworks in the industry (CIS, HIPAA / HITECH, PCI, etc) and
are compatible with these frameworks.

While the infrastructure deployed by this code employs a variety of security best practices including the AWS well
architected framework, it has not been certified to meet any compliance standards. To get a Reference Architecture that
is certified to meet CIS, PCI, HIPAA / HITECH, etc, [contact Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/contact/).
